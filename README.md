# Black-Litterman-entropy-pooling
Black Litterman model extended with entropy pooling

We extended our base Black-Litterman model with entropy pooling. Entropy pooling allows for better expression of relative views, e.g. asset A has better momentum than asset B, etc. In our example we rank 3 assets: A<B<C in rising order of preference.

Note that entropy pooling does not necessarily lead to better performance, but it does generate portfolio weights that are more intuitive. You can read more about entropy pooling from Meucci (2010) Fully Flexible Views: Theory and Practice.
